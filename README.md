Media Queries for Responsive Design

#### The assignment was to make use of media queries and make sure that it resizes on certain breakpoints. To minimize the issues of having to streamline my previous homework which was clearly not designed to be as responsive without media queries or Bootstrap. I've opted out of using EM and % for measurements for the first assignment.
